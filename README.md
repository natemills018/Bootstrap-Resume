Hints

1. Remember that you need a container, row and columns and you can have multiple rows on the page at once. You could put the header in one row, and the skills in another. It's up to you, but think about it logically.

2. You might want to checkout these components: Alerts, List Groups, Cards, and Jumbotron.

3. Using col-md as a breakpoint will help make your resume look better in mobile view. You can see what your resume looks like on an mobile screen in your Chrome Developer tools. Here's a screenshot of what it looks like. Toggle that and you can select what type of mobile device you want to emulate.
